## Authentication Server
This repository contains the implementation of different authentication methods, the purpose of this repository is to demonstrate how in express server we can implement these different methods of authentication and additionally it is for the juniors FrontEnd devs to practice on it and learn how these authentication will look like on FE.

The swagger endpoint of this server code is set to `/doc/`. the API documentation is self explanatory.

## Installation & Usage
To make things more easy and clear for initial setup, for this repository I have created a Dev Database in the MongoDB Atlas. considering that in mind all we need is install npm dependencies as shown below:

open up the terminal and navigate to the root directory, then run below command to install npm dependencies:
```
npm install
```

once that is done, you can now run the app in dev mode by running below command:
```
npm run dev
```
